5) Implement random number generator 

#----- Data Structures
Matrix: Template class implementing a 2D Matrix for linear algebra and solving systems of linear equations. 

Function: Abstract class describing a generic function that can be used by other routines 

Binary Tree: Implements an unbalenced binary tree data structure 

#----- Calculations / Routines
Integral: Currently implements trapezoidal and Rhomberg integration 

LU: Performs an LU decomposition of a square matrix for solving linear equations 

Factorial: Static implementation for calculating factorials efficiently.
